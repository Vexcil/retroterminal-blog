  <h2>About This Site</h2>
  <p>RetroTerminal is my personal corner of the web.</p>
  <p>Here I share notes from my own tech projects. Everything from emulation, self hosting, tinkering with old tech (game consoles, CRT TV's / PVM's, old audio equipment, indoor gardening and more!
     Everything is styled to feel like an old terminal glowing in the dark. Kinda like wargames.</p>
